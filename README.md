## Events
All events provide the same output values (inside the detail object)  
* `values` : Current slider values (array)  
* `handle` : Handle that caused the event (number)  
* `unencoded`: Slider values without formatting (array)  
* `tap` : Event was caused by the user tapping the slider (boolean)  
* `positions` : Left offset of the handles (array)

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `update` | Use this event when synchronizing the slider value to another element, such as an <input>. It fires every time the slider values are changed, either by a user or by calling API methods. Additionally, it fires immediately when bound. In most cases, this event should be more convenient than the 'slide' event. |
| `slide` | This event is useful when you specifically want to listen to a handle being dragged, but want to ignore other updates to the slider value. This event also fires on a change by a 'tap'. In most cases, the 'update' is the better choice. |
| `set` | Whenever a slider is changed to a new value, this event is fired. This function will trigger every time a slider stops changing, including after calls to the .set() method. You can consider this 'end of slide'. |
| `change` | This event is similar to the 'change' events on regular <input> elements. It fires when a user stops sliding, when a slider value is changed by 'tap', or on keyboard interaction. |
| `start` | This event fires when a handle is clicked (mousedown, or the equivalent touch events). |
| `end` | This event is the opposite of the 'start' event. If fires when a handle is released (mouseup etc), or when a slide is canceled due to other reasons (such as mouse cursor leaving the browser window). |
